I'm a PhD candidate at the [Laboratory of Macroevolution and Macroecology (LabMeMe)](http://ecologia.ib.usp.br/labmeme/Site_2/Home.html) at the [University of SÃ£o Paulo](http://www.usp.br), under the supervision of Dr. Tiago Quental.

My research interests basically concern trying to building a bridge between (macro)ecological mechanisms that might lead to the observed macroevolutionary patterns. I try to do this via phylogenetic comparative methods and diversification analysis using both molecular and fossil data.

Additionally, I have a particular interest in having deep knowledge of how everything I use in my day-to-day life works, from computers to my cellphone, from individual reactions to social behavior. I am never satisfied in settling with pre-configured stuff, so that's where I think my open-science/open-knowledge attitude comes from :-)

I hope you find anything interesting here! Feel free to contact me by clicking on the "Contact" link above!
