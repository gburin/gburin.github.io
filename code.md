I don't have many of my codes organized, so I'll upload them as soon as I start tidying them up.

Nevertheless, I have prepared some tutorials for my lab (in portuguese) that I will link below. I am still trying to deal with the format, so I apologize if everything looks shrinked in the middle of the screen!

Additionally, I have a few more in my [github page](https://github.com/gburin/labmeme).
